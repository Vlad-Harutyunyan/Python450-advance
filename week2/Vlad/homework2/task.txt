1)Simple Command Server

Create a client-server application for retrieving date and time from server using sockets. The client must establish a connection with the server and after that must prompt a user for command input. Client must send that command to the server, which will send the execution result back. If the server doesn't recognize a command, it must send an error message and keep the connection opened. The client must also provide an exit command for terminating the connection and closing both client and server applications.
The response from server must be shown to the user in a string format.

Supported commands (example):

>>> day
25
>>> month
04
>>> year
2020
>>> time
15:16
>>> someting
Unrecognized command 'something'
>>> exit


2)INI parser

Implement a parse_ini function, which must take an INI file path as an argument and return a dict object containing parsed data. The parser must raise an exception if provided configuration file contains invalid INI formatted data. If a value of any key can be represented by an integer, it must be castted to an integer. Rather than that every value must be of string type.
